## Five Good Python Habits


### Overview
#### This guide outlines essential Python coding habits that can significantly improve your code's readability, maintainability, and efficiency. By following these practices, you'll write cleaner, more professional, and easier-to-understand Python code.

### YouTube Tutorial
#### The tutorial I followed can be found on YouTube and is focused on refreshing Python basics. It provides the following tips:

1. Check if __name__ == '__main__':
    - Ensures the correct script runs when executed directly.
    - Helps identify the script's purpose (meant to be run or just imported).

2. Define a main() Function:
    - Organizes code by grouping functionalities.
    - Makes code structure similar to other languages (e.g., Java).

3. Use Smaller, Reusable Functions:
    - Improves code readability and maintainability.
    - Easier to modify or reuse functionalities in different parts of the code.

4. Use Type Annotations:
    - Catches potential errors early (e.g., wrong data type).
    - Improves code clarity and documentation (shows expected data types).

5. Use List Comprehensions:
    - Creates lists concisely.
    - Can be faster and more readable than traditional loops (in some cases).


### Purpose
#### The main purpose of this project is to revisit and practice the foundational concepts of Python programming. The code here serves as a reference and practice material for anyone looking to refresh their Python skills.
